#Thoughts about scheduling
================================================================================
- maybe capture percentage of correctness and time since last seen
- I ask myself: when do I want to see this again?
- I ask myself: how long before I think I will forget this?
- consider assigning an importance to each question; distinguish between how important it is to me, and when I think I will forget it; don't mix the two together
================================================================================
#Show schedules for each tag
================================================================================

User > UserTag's > QuestionTag's > Question's > Schedule's > Schedule.date_added

Want: most recently-added Schedule for each Question for the specified User
To get latest Schedule's, need Question's and User
To get Question's, need QuestionTag's
To get QuestionTag's, need UserTag's (specifically, need the tag's from UserTag's to get the QuestionTag's)
To get UserTag's, need User

Reference: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27544223/django-query-filter-many-to-many-to-many-etc
Reference: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3630619/django-queryset-for-many-to-many-field

Could just add this code to _get_tag2periods, just need to add UserTag's.
Keep track of most-recently schedule question by seeing if that question has a UserTag (need an extra query for each question though)

Data structure to process schedules:
  questions2schedules[question_id] == latest_schedule

Iterate through questions for each tag:
    for tag in tags:
        questions = ...
        questions.annotate(newest_date_added)
        for question in questions:
            tag2periods...

Resulting data structure:
  tag2periods['python']['now-10m'] = 4
              ^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^    ^
              tag       period       num_questions

Consider using the Max(pk) to get the latest-added schedule.

Note that a question with multiple tags will still only have one schedule, because the schedule is per user per question.

Q: How do I find the most-recently-added schedule of each question (datetime_added)?
A:
I have the queryset of questions.
*** Get the code working first, then worry about performance.  Easier to just ask on stackoverflow with existing code.
================================================================================
#Glossary / Terms / Nomenclature
================================================================================
answer - the "correct" answer associated with a question; a question can have 0 or 1 answers
attempt - a user's single attempt to answer a question; it is the user's guess as to the answer
hint - a hint for a question and answer (not yet implemented)
schedule - when the user wants to see a question again
question - a question
quiz - a set of associated questions (not yet implemented)
tag - a tag associated with a question; a question can have 0 to many tags
user tag - the tags that a user has selected indicating which questions they want to see

================================================================================
#Tests
================================================================================
Tests to add:
    12/27/14 add a test where there are no questions for whatever tags are selected, but selecting a different tag causes a question to be shown

question_next - ready (just a redirect to question)
question - shows a question with a form to input an attempt
    GET - show the question and an empty for for an attempt
    POST - post a new attempt
answer - shows the question, attempt, and answer, and a form to input a schedule
    GET - show the question, attempt, and answer
    POST - create a new schedule; redirect to question_next

Symbolic actions:
    - ask/show question (GET question)
    - submit answer (POST question) (really POSTing an attempt)
    - schedule question for next time (GET answer) (really GETting a specific attempt along with answer)
    - submit answer feedback (POST answer) (really POSTing a schedule)


----------------------------------------
Algorithm for deciding which question to show next:

question has no schedule
question has schedule with no interval

----------------------------------------
Time zones

USE_TZ = True in the settings.py file, so time zone support is enabled.  Times are stored as UTC.
To get the current time in UTC, use:
    from django.utils import timezone
    now = timezone.now()
Note that:
    >>> naive = datetime.datetime.utcnow()
    >>> aware = timezone.now()
utcnow() is naive.

#How to backup Postgres database and restore
================================================================================
Q: How to make a backup of the database?
A:
make dumpdb
    - this creates dumps in 2 different formats (plain and custom) and puts them in the db_dumps subdir with a datestamp on them, e.g.,
        -rw-r--r--  1 rob  staff  244938 Sep 26 17:26 dump.quizme.2014.09.26_Fri_17.26.21.plain
        -rw-r--r--  1 rob  staff  125248 Sep 26 17:26 dump.quizme.2014.09.26_Fri_17.26.21.custom

Q: How to restore from a backup?
A: 
make loaddb
    - this will create two databases named "restore_quizme_custom" and "restore_quizme_plain"
      and load the dumps 

Q: How to test a database loaded from a backup?
A:

Fri 3/6/15 4:17pm
    4:17pm adding a management command to export questions and answers in plain text
Fri 1/23/15 7:05am
    7:05am Working!  The usertag's are now working as well.
Mon 1/19/15 1:41pm
    1:41pm Fix so that modelformset_usertag is fixed on each POST so that it is saved.
    1:41pm It looks like I got _get_next_question() working correctly.  Hooray!
Thu 1/15/15 7:26am
    7:26am NEXT: review all of the view and model code to see if I can spot the bug(s)
Wed 1/14/15 9:42pm
    10:07pm NEXT: add some tests; schedules aren't working for CSS tag - it always shows the same question
    10:07pm Got interval counts working!
    9:42pm NEXT: _get_tag2periods -- still figuring out how to get into a data structure to easily add them to each tag in an ordered fashion
Thu 1/8/15 4:42pm
    4:43pm NEXT: implement number of questions due now, next 5 mins, next day, week, month, year
        get all questions for each tag; iterate through them and put them in time categories (annotate the latest schedule for each question)
        select_related all questions for each tag; annotate every question with latest schedule
    4:42pm Number of questions per tag has been added.
Sun 1/4/15 1:52pm
    1:52pm NEXT: add number of questions per tag to the form
Sat 1/3/15 11:05pm
    11:06pm NEXT: implement number of questions due now, next 5 mins, next day, week, month, year
    11:05pm implemented annotation of number of questions for each tag
    11:05pm got rid of old unused code
    11:05pm committed changes
Thu 1/1/15 9:44am
    6:06pm Getting this exception when submitting the interval:
        unsupported type for timedelta seconds component: Decimal
        self.date_show_next = time_now + interval 
        Reason: need to convert decimal to float()
    6:03pm Fixed next_question_new by adding an additional query.  All tests are now passing.
    10:13am QuestionTag.filter(tag__in=user_tags) is not correct.  Question.tag is a fk to Tag, not UserTag.  I need to get the tags that user_tags is pointing to.
    9:49am question_tags_no_schedule should have something, but it is None
    9:44am Got test_next_question_new passing with phantomjs, but it is failing with Firefox.
Wed 12/31/14 9:05am
    11:07pm figuring out how to select max() schedule for a given question (instead of max() schedule.datetime_added)
    9:10am continue on with test
    9:07am Changed utcnow() to timezone.now
    9:05am Read about timezones.  Ensured settings.py USE_TZ=True.  Added pytz to requirements.txt
Mon 12/29/14 9:04pm
    10:12pm finished Schedule.save().  now work on test
    10:08pm now save(commit) parm; just going to create a new datetime rather than saving twice to the db;
    9:58pm determined that the date's are now set until after the super() save() is called; now looking to see how to avoid the db call on the save()
    9:42pm added Schedule.save() method for setting self.interval_secs and self.date_show_next.  Now test to see if date_show_next is correct.
    9:04pm working on next_question_new(); now work on save() for Schedule() to calculate date_show_next and interval_secs
Sat 12/27/14 1:55pm
    10:47pm started _next_question_new() and _test_next_question_new; need to modify the queries; need to modify the test
    10:31pm NEXT: implement new _next_question() that utilizes Schedule
    5:21pm NEXT: add a test where there are no questions for whatever tags are selected, but selecting a different tag causes a question to be shown
    5:18pm Tests passing.  Changed the urls and views to the new ones and deleted the old one.  Fixed the issue with tests failing by 
    4:47pm NEXT: 4 tests are failing; need a separate page to indicate there are no questions; how was this working before?  Want to have the tags so that user can choose different tags.
    4:10pm NEXT: replace existing pages with new pages
    3:38pm added a migration; Schedule can now have null values for each field
    1:55pm NEXT: modify answer.html to include stuff from show_question_and_answer.html
Sat 12/27/14 9:36am
    9:37am NEXT: run tests; add tests
    9:36am fixed so that empty form doesn't have errors
Fri 12/26/14 7:33pm
    Fri 12/26 11:23pm NEXT: fix "This field is required" errors for answer() GET view
    Fri 12/26 11:21pm answer() GET view is working, except that errors "This field is required" are being shown
    Fri 12/26 11:14pm in answer() view, request.user is a SimpleLazyObject, but needs to be an int for the UserTag.objects.filter(user=user) query
    Fri 12/26 11:07pm created learn_form_select; somewhat working, except that it isn't showing the value for it
    Fri 12/26 10:45pm consider forgetting the ModelFormSchedule, and just use FormSchedule, because we only need interval_num and interval_unit
    Fri 12/26 10:41pm created a migration for Schedule and applied it; did a "make dumpdb"
    Fri 12/26 10:34pm NEXT: I modified models.Schedule to be subclassed from CreatedBy; now the schema is not correct because "schema.date_added" is now "schema.datetime_added"; need a South migration to fix it
    Fri 12/26 12:26pm NEXT: getting errors in ModelFormSchedule because it's a ModelForm; either set and hide some fields
    Fri 12/26 10:21pm NEXT: why is answer.html showing required fields and errors on the GET?
    Fri 12/26 10:19pm NEXT: get answer.html coded as intended (show question, attempt, answer)
    Fri 12/26 10:17pm NEXT: get answer() view working
    Fri 12/26 10:16pm I got the question() view and POST working.
    Fri 12/26 9:30pm need a different form without the hidden_question_id
    Fri 12/26 8:27pm working on question.html
    Fri 12/26 7:43pm remove hidden_question_id and replace with id_question
Sun 12/21/14 8:45am

Sat 7/12/14 9:12am
    9:28am LEFT OFF: learn_django-pagedown -- now add to template
    9:12am working on learn_django-pagedown
    9:12am I'm choosing django-pagedown; older; popular Irish guy; doc looks slightly better; fewer participants though; can always change out later
Fri 7/11/14 5:37pm
    5:56pm markdown options:
        django-pagedown v0.1.0 113 watchers; 27 forks; initial commit 4/20/12; timmyomahonny (21k on stackoverflow); 4 results on stackoverflow "django-pagedown"
            preview box
        django-markdown v0.6.1 97 watchers;  35 forks; more participants; initial commit 2/2/11; klen
            preview; 1 result on stackoverflow "django-markdown"
    5:53pm I'm just going to go with markdown
    5:37pm Should I go with markdown or HTML?  HTML seems dangerous.
        HTML - not safe; how about if I convert it to markdown and back again?
        markdown - safe
Fri 7/11/14 7:12am
    7:12am discovered that django-wysywig and django-tinymce store in html format; I'm thinking I might want markdown instead; markdown options:
        django-markdown
        Howard mentioned there there is a program to convert from any format to any other.
Thu 7/10/14 8:30am
    8:30am working on learn_django-wysiwyg
Wed 7/9/14 5:27pm
    5:27pm aborted learn_django-wysiwyg-redactor project; started learn_django-wysiwyg   
Wed 7/9/14 8:46am
    8:46am looking at WYSIWYG editors; started a learn project for learn_django-wysiwyg-redactor 
Tue 7/8/14 8:30am
    8:30am Added questions yesterday.  Tried running it now, and got this error:
        Errors:
        hidden_question_id
        This field is required.
        (note that no tags were selected)
      and then on the next page this error:
        Exception Type: ValidationError
        Exception Value:    
        [u'ManagementForm data is missing or has been tampered with']
        Exception Location: /Users/rob/.virtualenvs/quizme/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/forms/formsets.py in management_form, line 89

    I then went back to the home page and now it is working.  There might be an issue with having no tags selected to selecting some tags.

Sun 7/6/14 1:33pm
    1:52pm WORKING!  Got it working:
        - can select tags for which questions to ask
        - questions are ordered by:
            - no attempts get asked first
            - older attempts get asked before newer attempts
    1:33pm modified code to do two queries, one for no attempts, and for newest attempt
Sun 7/6/14 8:08am
    8:10am Modify the learn_* app to run in Postgres instead of sqlite
    8:08am I confirmed that the quizme tests are being run in Postgres
Sat 7/5/14 8:09am
    11:31am Work on django learn program to figure out why null's aren't the oldest in my queryset
    8:09am figured out how null is used with annotate and ordering
Sat 7/5/14 12:14am
    12:14am NEXT: get the latest test working to return a question with no attempts
    12:14am Got the tests working.
Fri 7/4/14 4:19pm
    4:19pm NEXT: figure out how to annote the newest attempt for a given Question
    4:19pm added learn projects to learn how to use backwards lowercase model name for the reverse relationship.

    8:38am DONE: got initial code in place for views.next_question()
    8:02am NEXT: add code to select question based on tags
Mon 6/30/14 8:41pm
    8:41pm added test to assert that no questions appear when no tags are selected
Mon 6/30/14 5:41pm
    5:58pm STATUS: line 111 is failing for some reason; see what it looks like in the browser
    5:57pm DONE: put _login() in separate function
    5:42pm NEXT: create a test to confirm that view only gets questions with tag selected
    5:41pm DONE: finished test_tags_created_automatically_for_user
Mon 6/30/14 8:26am
    9:09am LEFT OFF: working on test to assert that tags get created
    8:33am Add tests:
        - verify that tags get created
    8:26am DONE: Add makefile for running tests with both browsers.
Sun 6/29/14 8:11am
    8:21am Ran with both firefox and phantomjs.  All tests pass.
    8:21am Added tests for bad password, username.  They pass.
    8:11am Add these tests:
        DONE - wrong password for login
        DONE - run tests with both firefox and phantomjs
Sat 6/28/14 10:31pm
    11:59pm Next: add more tests.
    11:59pm Got test_1 working!  Hooray!  
    11:21pm Now got Makefile targets and commands working for recreating the db.
    11:20pm Now got dependency on emailusername for questions
    11:20pm Figured out how to do South dependencies.
    11:04pm Removed migrations.  Created new initial migrations.
    10:43pm Remove the existing migrations and db and create new ones.
    10:42pm When running tests, get this error:
        Creating test database for alias 'default'...
        FATAL ERROR - The following SQL query failed: ALTER TABLE "questions_question" ADD CONSTRAINT "user_id_refs_id_e3223746" FOREIGN KEY ("user_id") REFERENCES "emailusername_user" ("id") DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED;
        The error was: relation "emailusername_user" does not exist

        Error in migration: questions:0001_initial
    10:42pm Created tests.
    10:31pm Look at Atlatl and copy how to do tests.
    10:31pm With the learn command I think I understand how to use the queries.  But first I want to get tests in place so I can test things.
Sat 6/28/14 2:49pm
    4:43pm Got learn management command working.
           SOLUTION: needed __init__.py in /management/ directory
    4:39pm Also tried adding management command to emailusername, but still no luck.  Aargh!
    4:32pm I added the management command, but it isn't being seen, I don't know why.
    4:32pm Next: add a management command to see what the data is and play around with queries
    3:19pm Now add code to just query for questions with those tags enabled.
    3:19pm It seems to be working!  
    3:16pm Add modelformset to render() args
    3:16pm Added template code to show_question_and_answer.html; confirmed that it was already added to show_questions.html
    2:49pm Now add code to get the tags and only query for questions with those tags, and add template code
    2:49pm Added the call to _create_and_get_usertags()
Sat 6/28/14 11:21am
    11:24am Figure out where to call _create_and_get_tags() from in the view.
    11:21am I think the function is ready.
Fri 6/27/14 7:58am
    8:13am 
    7:58am commented different models
Thu 6/26/14 5:41pm
    5:41pm What is difference/relationship between Tag, QuestionTag, and UserTag
    5:41pm worked on _create_and_get_usertags()
Thu 6/26/14 7:48am
    7:55am decide what to do if form is invalid; handle it here or in the main view?
    7:54am need to complete create_and_get_persontags(); 
    7:54am copied-and-pasted the learn project code to a new create_and_get_persontags() function.
    7:49am needed:
        view:
            create modelformset_persontag
        template:
            add modelformset_persontag just like in learn project
    7:48am learn_form_checkbox_for_manytomany_field - looking at to figure out how to transfer knowledge to quizme
Wed 6/25/14 4:33pm
    4:47pm ran the app; went into the admin; added some tags, another question and answer; things seem to be working
    4:45pm looked at the existing cddjango projects; looks like these two are almost identical:
        learn_many_to_many_with_needed_related_names_to_avoid_conflict
        learn_multiple_many_to_many_in_one_model_with_needed_related_names_to_avoid_conflict
Wed 6/25/14 8:00am
    8:01am next: add the checkboxes to quizme (the models and migrations are now in place)
    8:00am resuming work on this
Sun 6/8/14 10:01pm
    10:26pm next: add the checkboxes to quizme (the models and migrations are now in place)
    10:02pm next: add comments for quizme model reverse accessors
    10:01pm done: learn_many_to_many_with_needed_related_names_to_avoid_conflict now works
Sun 6/8/14 1:40pm
    1:40pm IN-PROGRESS: learn_many_to_many_with_needed_related_names_to_avoid_conflict -- still getting errors during syncdb
    1:40pm learn_many_to_many_multiple_in_one_model -- finished and got working
Sat 6/7/14 9:00pm
    9:00pm next: clean up other models; add comments for related fields
    9:00pm added QuestionTag model
Sat 6/7/14 9:02am
    6:21pm the issue is that
        class Tag
            questions = models.ManyToManyField(Question, through=UserTag)
        so a Tag as many questions, and a question can have many tags.  But the through model doesn't have a question foreign key.
        I think it should be a different "through" model.  Maybe a "through" model of QuestionTagM2M
    6:18pm added related_name args; now down to this one error:
        questions.tag: 'questions' is a manually-defined m2m relation through model UserTag, which does not have foreign keys to Question and Tag
    6:18pm created django learn project: learn_many_to_many_with_needed_related_names_to_avoid_conflict
    5:58pm this helps me understand it: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9630922/multiple-m2m-in-django
    5:47pm walk through the specific errors
    5:39pm added some related_name's, still getting the same errors
    10:15am when running quizme, I'm getting:
        django.core.management.base.CommandError: One or more models did not validate:
        questions.tag: Accessor for field 'user' clashes with related m2m field 'User.tag_set'. Add a related_name argument to the definition for 'user'.
        questions.tag: 'questions' is a manually-defined m2m relation through model UserTag, which does not have foreign keys to Question and Tag
        questions.tag: Accessor for m2m field 'users' clashes with related field 'User.tag_set'. Add a related_name argument to the definition for 'users'.
    10:13am next: got back to quizme and see what error is
    10:12am I got the related_name example working
    9:22am now I'm getting:
         IntegrityError('myapp_book.author_id may not be NULL',))
    9:22am SOLVED; REASON: my db is db.sqlite3 instead of my.db, so I needed to modify "mycmd"
    9:19am commented-out the delete() lines, now I'm getting:
         OperationalError('table myapp_book has no column named book_title',))
    9:18am I'm getting this error:
         OperationalError('no such column: myapp_book.author_id',))
    9:02am next: work on related_name
Sat 5/31/14 8:33am
    8:33am left off last night trying to get a new learn script with related_name to work
Fri 5/30/14 5:52pm
    5:53pm created new db, but syncdb still gives:
        CommandError: One or more models did not validate:
        questions.tag: 'tags' is a manually-defined m2m relation through model UserTag, which does not have foreign keys to Tag and Tag
    5:52pm decided to create a new db called "quizme" owned by quizme
Thu 5/29/14 5:28pm
    5:28pm next: complete the views.get_tags() function
Thu 5/29/14 7:35am
    7:57am complete the views.get_tags() function
    7:57am added the template; added get_tags() function
    7:37am there are two templates: 
            GET: show_question.html (this is where to add them)
            POST: show_question_and_answer.html
    7:35am add the tag checkboxes
Wed 5/28/14 9:02pm
    9:12pm next: add the tag checkboxes
    9:12pm yes, tags are now working
    9:10pm see if migration worked and I can now look at tags
    9:10pm created and applied South migration for questions:
        ./manage.py schemamigration questions --auto
        ./manage.py migrate questions
    9:07pm How to create a new South migration?
    9:06pm Yes, I have South migrations
    9:06pm see if I have South installed
    9:02pm the app is working; but the admin gives the error;
           I got the error in the admin when clicking on a tag to see details for the tag:
            ProgrammingError at /admin/questions/tag/2/

            LINE 1: ...e_user"."id" FROM "emailusername_user" INNER JOIN "questions...
        I think I need to do a syncdb or migrate.
Tue 5/27/14 5:34pm
    6:05pm got this error when trying to create a tag in the admin:
        ProgrammingError at /admin/questions/tag/add/

        LINE 1: DELETE FROM "questions_tag_users" WHERE "questions_tag_users...
    6:03pm creating a new tag in the admin: Users field is required; how to make it not required?  blank=True?
    6:02pm able to login as superuser@bednark.com / p (admin account)
    6:00pm see if I have South setup
    6:00pm create an admin account to login to the admin
    5:52pm "manage.py runserver" giving error:

        SOLUTION: make a many2many field with User instead of 'User'
    5:51pm models are correct; see if I can add tags for a question in the admin
    5:45pm see if models are correct
    5:45pm get tags working on quizme program
    5:44pm next: continue on quizme program
    5:44pm learn_form_checkbox_for_manytomany_field working!

Tue 5/27/14 8:10am
    8:10am Got it working!  Now update learn_form_checkbox_for_manytomany_field with it.
Sun 5/25/14 8:10pm
    10:42pm I finished posting the question to stackoverflow.
    10:12pm post to stackoverflow!
    9:30pm try: >>> f.fields['name'].label = "Username"
    9:09pm Post to stackoverflow:
    Tags: django-forms django-modelformsets django-modelform django
    Title: How to set formset form widget.label with value of other model field
    Body:
        I have a modelformset for a `PersonTag` model with 3 fields, and I want to display a checkbox widget for the `PersonTag.enabled` field, and no widget for the other two fields.  For each checkbox, I want the label to be set to the `PersonTag.tag` value for that model instance.  How might I accomplish this?

    8:10pm see if I can use a HiddenInput
Fri 5/23/14 4:16pm
    4:16pm preparing to post to stackoverflow
Fri 5/23/14 7:07am
    7:51am tried the "for field in form", but it's now showing the widgets (post to stackoverflow for this)
    7:07am to add the tag name, consider:
        1) subclassing BaseFormSet.add_fields() to add an additional field
            https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/forms/formsets/
        -or-
        2) using HiddenInputs and using the value of those in the template to specify the name
        -or-
        3) just adding an additional key to the formset dict in the view, and using that in the template
        -or-
        4)  
            {% for field in form %}
                <th>{{ field.label }}</th>
                <td>{{ field.widget }}</td>
            {% endfor %}
        -or-
        5) Give a label to the tag field.  Maybe Django will show the label but not the HiddenInput widget
        -or-
        6) look at the Django source code for a widget

        3) just adding an additional key to the formset dict in the view, and using that in the template
Thu 5/22/14 6:55am
    7:21am now figure out how to add the tag name
    7:21am fixed the three projects that are using it
    7:21am it works!  
    6:56am test out my modelformset_factory(widgets=...) fix
Wed 5/21/14 7:19am
    5:45pm I discovered my problem!  I'm specifying the HiddenInput widgets in the forms.PersonTagForm, but that form is not being used by the factory.  I need to pass the widgets arg to the factory.
    7:55am I queried stackoverflow for "django modelformset_factory hiddeninput" and found some posts, one that mentions different behavior with the "extra" field; try extra=0 and extra=1
    7:19am post question to stackoverflow
    Tags: Django django-modelformsets django-modelform factory widget
    Title: Why doesn't Django modelformset_factory formset recognize HiddenInput widgets?
        For my ModelForm, I'm specifying two fields as HiddenInput fields.  This works as desired if I use a ModelForm instance in my view and template.  But when I use modelformset_factory, the fields are no longer hidden.  Why not?

Tue 5/20/14 7:45am
    7:47am learn_modelform_hidden_field -- HiddenInput widgets are working; it is correctly only showing the checkbox for the GET, and the dropdowns are hidden fields
Mon 5/19/14 5:30pm
    5:41pm learn_modelform_hidden_field: LEFT OFF modifying it to use a ModelForm instead of a ModelFormset
    5:30pm try using just a ModelForm without a formset
Mon 5/19/14 6:58am
    2:42pm create stackoverflow question
    7:23am fix "model = Tag" for TagForm in the other projects
    7:22am I discovered that I had set "model = Person" for the TagForm; not sure what that was doing
    6:58am try:
        o look at Django code
        o try hidden widgets
        o try removing fields
Sat 5/17/14 8:22pm
    8:59pm consider asking Aaron, Kyle, or Nick (put it in a git repo)
    8:59pm consider asking StackOverflow
    8:59pm I created learn_modelformset_make_field_hidden_or_remove_it and set widgets in the Meta for the form, but it didn't seem to do anything.
    8:22pm this shows two options:
            1) make field a HiddenInput field
            -or-
            2) delete it from fields
Sat 5/17/14 4:42pm
    5:00pm run with debugger and inspect the widgets
    4:46pm I want to change so that only the checkbox is shown
        consider: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11736322/django-how-to-override-fields-of-a-modelform-in-a-modelformset
    4:42pm learn_form_checkbox_for_manytomany_field - seems to be working; now figure out how to only show checkbox
Thu 5/15/14 7:43am
    7:44am how is it that tags for both users are showing up?
        A: It's because I'm using 
            queryset=PersonTag.objects.all())
        I have now fixed it by using filter(person=person)
    7:43am figure out how to only show checkbox and not the other two fields of the PersonTag ManyToMany field
Wed 5/14/14 5:03pm
    5:06pm get the POST working:
    5:05pm getting this error when submitting:

Wed 4/9/14 8:45am
    8:45am figured out how to use inspect module to check for classes and methods
Tue 4/8/14 5:29pm
    5:36pm learn_formset: got most of attributes printing; cleaned_data is still raising an AttributeError
    5:29pm left off in learn_formset, printing out attr's of a form/formset.
           For some reason, dir(form) shows cleaned_data as an attribute, but it only
           gets shown if is_valid() is run.
Fri 4/4/14 8:35am
    8:39am consider stepping into the Django code and seeing what the error is
    8:35am learn_formset line 30: My formset is not valid, and there are no formset.errors or form.errors.  Why not?
    8:34am figuring out where I left off
Mon 3/31/14
    9:08am modelformset's are tied to a queryset; does a ModelForm object have to be tied to a model instance?
    8:20am learn_formset: started
    8:10am learn_forms_inline_formsets: not working; start a new easier one instead
Fri 3/28/14 
    5:30pm need to figure out how to process multiple forms from a template; use formsets; start with a project for learning how to use them
Thu 3/27/14
    8:24am learn_form_checkbox_for_manytomany_field: added instance; now need to add to template
Wed 3/26/14 5pm
    5:20pm next: finish learn_form_checkbox_for_manytomany_field and learn_checkboxes_for_every_boolean_record
    5:19pm learn_form_1: modified mycmd to specify all the fields
    5:02pm working on getting learn_form_1 mycmd working
    5:00pm Forget about figuring out how to use existing field value if not specified.
Wed 3/26/14 8am
    9:03am NEXT: figure out how to use existing field value if not specified (just like for Atlatl)
    9:00am got learn_ModelForm working with not requiring all fields.  However, updating an existing instance does not use the existing field value if not specified.
    8:58am got ModelForm working when creating a new instance in learn_ModelForm.  However, when updating an existing instance, the fields are still required.  Make them not required.
    8:44am figuring how how a ModelForm takes fields
    8:35am beginning learn_form_1 mycmd
Tue 3/25/14 4pm
    5:10pm LEFT OFF: get learn_form_1 mycmd working
    5:09pm modified learn_form_1 mycmd to understand how to use a ModelForm;
    5:00pm creating a project to learn how to map an instance
    4:53pm Now need to figure out how to map an instance to the form:
        MyForm(instance=my_instance)
    4:52pm Figured out how to instantiate a form.
    4:51pm Working on learn_form_1 to figure out how to instantiate a form();
    4:50pm Working on learn_form_checkbox_for_manytomany_field
Mon 3/17/14 8am
    understanding how a single checkbox should work in the follow scenarios:
        - ManyToMany field with two specified values
        - a new instance
        - an existing instance
    working on learn_form_checkbox_for_manytomany_field
Fri 3/14/14 10am
    detailing how the functionality should work
Wed 3/12/14 5pm
    left off: exploring different tagging methods after googling; explore django-taggit by Alex Gaynor some more, and also some blog posts
    Next: get checkboxes for the boolean values
    + Got working with showing the page.  
    resuming work on learn_checkboxes_for_every_boolean_record
    + modified code for view, forms, and html template
Tue 3/11/14 9am
    Working on the view for learn_checkboxes_for_every_boolean_record
Mon 3/10/14 5pm
    Decided I'm done with learn_aaron_inline_formsets.
    Resuming learn_checkboxes_for_every_boolean_record
    Created the models, now figuring out what to create for the view.
Fri 3/7/14 5pm
    Reading through Django documentation on formsets.
Thu 3/6/14 6pm
    Copied Aaron Sykes' inlineformset_factory project into learn.  
    Read about sqlite3 in wikipedia.
    LEFT OFF: documenting how Aaron's inlineformset_factory works.
Thu 3/6/14 8am
    Added a boolean field to learn_ModelForm and proved that it uses a checkbox.
    Went through learn_form_1 and determined what it was doing.
    Went through learn_form_1a_customize_form_html and determined it was using html instead of {{ form.as_p }}
    Next: keep going through other learn*form* projects to get a thorough understanding of forms.
Wed 3/5/14 5pm
    LEFT OFF: discovered stackoverflow post of using formsets for each one
    Looked at Postgresql bit strings.  Don't see it supported in Django.
    Continuing to work on checkboxes project.

Thu 2/13/14 7am
    Working on Django learn project for checkboxes for all the tags.
Tue 2/11/14 7am
    Next: implement tags via checkboxes or radio buttons.  First create a Django learn project.
    Consider:
        
        event.members = form.cleaned_data['members']
    Add saving of tags for a user:
        default to all tags

Mon 2/10/14 9am
    Next:
    It now works!!!!
    SOLUTION: added admin.py code 
    I looked at learn_django_doc_example_custom_user_mycmd_create_users and found that I forgot
    all the admin.py code.  I have now added it.
Sun 2/9/14 3pm
    Next: try the learn project to see how it's storing passwords
    Reason: it looks like creating a user through the admin is not encrypting the password.
    Why can I login as a superuser, but not as a non-superuser?
    deleted rbednark@gmail.com and then re-created:
        FAIL: rbednark@gmail.com / p
    manage.py createsuperuser
        SUCCESS: superuser@bednark.com / p
    attempts:
        FAIL: rob / rob 
        FAIL: rbednark@gmail.com / p
    I have now set AUTH_USER_MODEL in settings.py

    What is being authenticated?  auth_user or emailusername_user?
    Currently logged-in as: [rob]
    auth_user:
        rob
        rbednark
    emailusername_user:
        rbednark@gmail.com
    I think it's because I forgot settings AUTH_USER_MODEL in settings.py

Thu 2/6/14 9am
    I set a trace to see what the error is.  It is here:
        /Users/rob/.virtualenvs/quizme/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/contrib/auth/backends.py(16)authenticate()
    Added a logout link via a base.html page.
    login as rbednark@gmail.com / p: 
        Your username and password didn't match. Please try again.
        (I confirmed that rbednark@gmail.com / p in the admin are correct, and is_active=True)
    login as rob / rob:
        
Wed 2/5/14 7am
    Problem: getting this error:
        Cannot assign "<SimpleLazyObject: <User: rob>>": "Attempt.user" must be a "User" instance.
    Theory: I think it's because I'm logged-in as an auth_user instead of an emailusername_user
    Next: add a logout link
    Status: added a base.html page.  Including it in the other 2 pages.
Tue 2/4/14 6pm
    Next: resolve the csrf error
    Got the login screen working.  Now there is a csrf error:
        CSRF token missing or incorrect.
    Got the django learn project working to use the login screen.
Tue 2/4/14 8am
    Next: implement custom login page
    Got learn_custom_user_login_page_form_view working.
Mon 2/3/14 5pm
    Working on learn_custom_user_login_page_form_view
    Added a custom form.  Now add a custom view, subclassed from login() view

    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/default/

    Start implementing the login form.  We'll need it anyway.

    If I did implement saving an anonymous user as a user, it would have to be done
    when they first go into a quiz.  That could potentially mean a lot of anonymous users.
    Could choose to purge them after every n days.
    Furthermore, might need a way to convert an anonymous user to an existing user.
    Maybe that would be easy -- just fill in their fields (email addr, first name, last name)
Mon 2/3/14 8am
    Anonymous users do not have a User instance.  Figuring out how to save them as an actual user.  Created a django learn project.
    Implementing...
    Maybe it's not worth it.
Sun 2/2/14 8pm
    Fixed error.
    Now getting another error:
        Cannot assign "1": "Attempt.user" must be a "User" instance.
Sun 2/2/14 11am
    Changed from sqlite3 to postgres.  Create initial migrations again.  Now get an error:
        column questions_attempt.datetime_updated does not exist
        LINE 1: ...empt"."id", "questions_attempt"."datetime_added", "questions...
    Next: need to allow superuser to add tags/questions in Django Admin.
    Added Tag ManyToMany with Question.
    Added ManyToMany both ways in Django Admin.
Sat 2/01/14 10am
    Next: add tags
    Users now work.
    Added foreign keys to User.
    Added a user_ app to quizme.
    Now add user to my model.
    Satisfied that subclassing AbstractBaseUser also has all the authentication/permission functionality.
    On plan from Charleston.
    learn_django_doc_example_custom_user -- this is done and just creates a custom user by subclassing AbstractBaseUser.
    I figured out that create_user() is a method of the manager, not of the user.

Sun 1/26/14 2pm
    On plane to Charleston.  Working on creating users and logging-in.
Fri 1/24/14 6pm
    Did some googling.  It doesn't look like it's easy to modify the Django authentication to use email addresses instead of usernames.
    Decided to use Tom Christie's django-email-as-username library.
    Working on learn_django_email_as_username
Thu 1/23/14 5pm
    Finished new template_django_1_6_1
    Now working on learn_django_user_authentication
    Left off: reading about Django user authentication
        https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/topics/auth/
        https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/topics/auth/customizing/
Thu 1/23/14 9am
    Working on creating and authenticating users.  Creating a learn project for it.  Right now, I'm creating a new template_django_1_6_1 based off of Django 1.6.1
    Left to do: 
        settings.py
Wed 1/22/14 9pm
    Got it working.  Works with 3 questions.  Cycles through.
    Next step?  Maybe tests.
Wed 1/22/14 5pm
    I think I got it working.  Add another question to see if it really works.
Wed 1/22/14 8am
    I added a "question" field to the form, but this doesn't make any sense.  Question is not an input.  I think I just added it to make it easy to display the question.  Take it out and pass it explicitly.

    Do I really want a different template for showing the first question vs showing an answer
    and the next question?  For now it's fine.  Keep moving on.
Tue 1/21/14 8am
    Left off changing field names in forms and views.
    States:
        - initial GET:
            - show the question
        - POST
            - new template:
                - show the answer, the user's attempt, the question
                - have a NEXT button be a GET for the next question
Mon 1/20/14 6pm
    I got the hidden input to work.  Now need to figure out what to do next.
Mon 1/20/14 8am
    Trying different things to get the HiddenInput to work.  I think it is due to these lines in the view:
            form_attempt.fields['question_id'] = question.id
            form_attempt.fields['question_id'] = None
    I think it should be something like ['initial'], otherwise I think it's overriding the widget.
Fri 1/17/14 6pm
    Tried putting explicit <input> in the form, and then it put the <input> widget in the "value".
    Baffling.
Fri 1/17/14 8am
    Googled.  Tried .as_hidden and using ()'s when setting the widget.  Still not working.  Might not to explicitly put it in the form.
    Look at the Django code to see what the HiddenInput widget does.
Thu 1/16/14 8am
    Added errors to form so can see what the error is.
    It is saying that question_id is not present in the form.
    I set a breakpoint and confirmed that question_id is not in request.POST.
    Now check to see if question_id is getting in the form.  I see it as one of the fields, but because I'm not using form.as_p(), it's not getting put into the form.
Wed 1/15/14 8am
    Figured out that my for is not valid.  Now trying to figure out how to show Django form errors manually, and then eventually using Django generic class-based views.
Tue 1/14/14 5pm
    Got view to show question working, and next_question() code working.
    Now getting an exception after clicking "submit".
Tue 1/14/14 9am
    Added code for next_question().  
    Added code to pass question_id as hidden field.  Now test it.
Mon 1/13/14 8am
    Looking at django-quiz to see how he did it.
    Still have to decide how to pass fields.  I want to go with hidden fields.
    Got django-quiz up and running.  Needed to do a "django-admin.py startproject", and add the apps.  I didn't actually get the templates working.
    Options:
        pass hidden fields
        pass query parameters (http://quizme.com?parm=value
Fri 1/9/14 8pm
    Got the hidden field working!  Now add it to quizme.
    Want to redirect to the next question by passing the hidden value of the current question.
    Could also pass it in the URL as the ID of the question.
Fri 1/9/14 8am
    working on getting hidden field working; found form.fields['myfield']['initial'] but it is not right
Thu 1/9/14 6pm
    Working on learn_form_hidden_field.  Got the hidden field, now need to see if it's passing a value.
    It's passing the initial value and saving that.  Now I have to see if I can set it to something else.
    How do I set the value for a field?
    Set a trace and see what the values are.
Thu 1/9/14 9am
    o Learned how to use a hidden field.  Now need to figure out how to set the value for the hidden field in the view instead of just using the initial value.
      Created learn_form_hidden_field.
Wed 1/8/14 6pm
    o Got admin working.
    o Next: redirect to the next question; started working on; need hidden field
Wed 1/8/14 10am
    o Got it saving an attempt.  Now need to work on a redirect to the next question.  Also need to add Attempt to the admin.  Left off making changes to the admin.
Tue 1/7/14 6pm
    o Got the form displaying correctly for the GET.
      ERROR when submitting: 'FormAttempt' object has no attribute 'cleaned_data'

Tue 1/7/14 9am
    o Working on the view and template.  Decided to use form for the answer, and just put the question in directly.  Still modifying the view code and the template.
Mon 1/6/14 6pm:
  o I'm trying to figure out how to do a read-only field; what I want:
        o display the question
        o have a box for the answer:
        o when submitting, only allow the answer
    Maybe what I should do is create a form just for the answer, and in the template put the questionas well.
  
Mon 1/6/14 8am:
  o work on implementing the view; was going to use a form, not sure if I use Django Forms (because I have readonly field of question) or not.

Fri 1/3/14:
  
  o got it working; added a question and answer via the admin
  o added 'questions' to INSTALLED_APPS
  o enabled the admin
  o added requirements.txt file
  o installed South
  o got Django 1.6.1 installed
Mon 10/14/13:
  o LEFT OFF: working on learn_GenericForeignKey.polymorphic.contentType; can't figure out how to chain querysets together
  o worked on the models; now figuring out how to use GenericForeignKey for the tag
  o played with django_versioning again to see how it works; decided to continue working on the models
Thu 10/3/13
  o NEXT STEP: create a basic question and answer models, and add the Django REST Framework API
  o completed the Django REST Framework Quickstart, and skimmed the tutorial
  o working on learn_django_rest_framework project
Tue 10/1/13
  o create learn_django_rest_framework project
Mon 9/30/13
  o If I use a REST API and AJAX, what should my first feature be?
    Being able to add questions.  Tag questions.  Modify questions.
  o installed django REST Framework: pip install djangorestframework
  o What should I do next?  I would like to create a REST API and use a JavaScript front-end.  Maybe I will use django-rest-framework.

Thu 9/19/13
  o got it running; can see revisions in Django Admin; 
  o need to run syncdb before versioning_setup
  o installed django-debug-toolbar
Wed 9/18/13
  o ran "manage.py version_setup..." command and got:
    ImportError: No module named debug_toolbar
  o finished modifying code
Tue 9/17/13
  o started playing with django-versioning in learn_django-versioning_package
        LEFT OFF: adding code to models.py
  o researching model instance versioning approaches (capturing every time an instance is modified)
Mon 9/16/13
  o added models

================================================================================
o 7/1/15 FEATURE: in addition to tags, consider keywords
o 6/28/15 FEATURE: show how long (duration/interval) it has been between when we last answered the question and now; this will me when I answer determine how long I want to set the next interval (both question and answer pages)
o 6/2/15 BUG: I added a new question with tags=[file_systems, unix]; when I went to quiz myself with a bunch of tags selected, but neither [file_systems, unix], I still got that question; after I answered that question, I then got another question with those same tags
  - it might be because the schedules query 
  - questions being shown that should not be:
        http://localhost:8000/question/1052/  
        http://localhost:8000/question/1053/
o 5/29/15 show list of selected tags on one line (instead of having to look through list of all tags) #high
o 05/17/15 show the number of questions recently answered/scheduled (e.g., 0-10mins=[5]  10-30mins=[12] 30m-2h=[4]  0-2h=[21])  #high
o 04/03/15 add a "note" section to the schedule, as a scratchpad, and also to mention what I forgot and what to remember next time  #high
o 3/28/15 allow a tree structure of tags, so that selecting a tag would select that and everything below it [suggested by Nev]
o 3/10/15 don't allow duplicate tags to be created
o 3/10/15 show the question number on the answer page, so that it can be visually seen to manually edit the question in the admin
o Export (export questions via csv / json / yaml / xml / python data structure / plain text).  Find a way to maintain referential integrity.
o 02/11/15 On the answer page, add an input box where the user can type to practice the answer.  Maybe or maybe not save it (only value in saving it would be to see the effort that was made).  #high
o 01/23/15 Django Admin: be able to click on the answer from the list of questions page.
o 02/15/15 Django Admin: show the associated question(s) for each answer, and be able to click on the question 
o 01/23/15 Django Admin: add ability to edit answer in same page as editing question.
o 2/11/15  Show the schedule numbers for the total of selected tags (just like is done for each individual tag)  #high
o 01/23/15 Add search to Django admin to search in questions and answers.
o 12/31/14 Added schedule intervals for "immediate" and "never"
o 12/31/14 Allow a quiz mode that consists of a set of questions, and the user can go back and change their answers as much as they want (e.g., as part of an interview)
o 12/31/14 Make it possible to view questions that don't have any tags ("untagged")
o 12/31/14 Have a "review all" mode that goes through all questions for the selected tags, showing you number seen and number remaining.
o 12/31/14 REFACTOR: change all datetime_* variables to either date_* or time_*
o 12/31/14 Change all timezones to UTC
o 12/30/14 Implement variations (a question can have variations -- other questions that are similar but modified in a different way; e.g., 2+3=? could be a variation of 2+2=?); this is helpful so that you don't get in the habit of seeing the question and remembering the answer without understanding it
o 12/27/14 ask how well the question was answered (maybe percentage; excellent / good / bad)
o 12/21/14 Modify to pass question number in endpoint instead of as hidden field
o 12/21/14 Add contributors.md
o 12/21/14 Add to readthedocs
o 02/15/15 Consider adding a priority field (interval is ideally when you want to see it again, but priority is how important it is to you; so 2 different questions could have the same interval, but the one with the higher priority gets shown first; however, what to do if question1 has interval 1 month and priority "high", and question2 has interval 1 minute and priority "low" -- which gets shown first?)
o 12/21/14 Add tasks to either github issues or to Trello
o 11/17/14 add ability to select all or none for tags
o 10/20/14 add search ability, to search questions/answers for specified keywords
o 10/20/14 in the admin, when viewing a question, show the answer as an inline
o 10/20/14 in the admin, when viewing a question, add a link to jump to the answer to view/edit it
o 10/19/14 upgrade Django to latest (currently using 1.6.7; latest is 1.7)
o 10/18/14 per Steven Jonas, have a way to find other questions (or bookmarked webpages) with similar content to help form associations and new insights
o 10/18/14 have questions that are a single webpagge to review (a url), and show the content of the webpage instead of just a link
o 8/17/14 enabling tags during an answer does not enable it when the next question is shown (but it does work if enabled when asking a question)
BUG: clicking on tag (to disable) during a question does not disable it when the answer is shown
o Show linefeeds as linefeeds for questions/answers/attempts (add <br/> tags; or add a rich text editor)
o 7/15/14 - add admin "list_filter" setting to be able to filter by tags on questions and answers
o use a single template: combine show_question.html and show_question_and_answer.html
o add an inline in the admin to edit the answer for a given question
o ability to change tags for the question shown #high
o Frequency (user selects when they want to see again (hr, day, 2 days, week, month, 2 mos)
o deploy to heroku
o 7/14/14 - add a "SKIP" button to skip a question
o 7/14/14 - capture the elapsed time that it took the user to reply
o 7/14/14 - show all questions/answers for given tags on a single page
o add documentation for other users to use
o display url's as clickable url's (href's)
o Import (import questions via csv / json / yaml / python data structure)
o Questions (add questions from the web page instead of the admin)
o Tags (be able to tag questions, and then select tags from which to select questions)
    DONE - select a single tag to use for a quiz
    DONE - select multiple tags to use for a quiz
    - consider allowing a hierarchy of tags, e.g.,
        Programming
            Languages
                Python
                Perl
                C
            Methodologies
                Agile
      Maybe allowing multiple parent/child relationships.
o NewUser registration
    - page to create account
    - email address verification/registration
o tests
o Footer: 
    - show tags
    - show how many times seen
    - show how many times answered
    - show last time seen
    - show total number of questions
o Review mode: just show questions and answers
o email questions

o Rich Text for questions and answers
o graph database
o Questions (modify questions from the web page while asking the question)
o unique url's (e.g., either based on question words, or based on an id)
o "Ignore" tag -- never see the question again
o private questions/answers
o add Google Analytics

Front-end:
o ability to add questions/answers
o ability to modify questions/answers on-the-fly

o versions of questions/answers

DONE o 8/29/14 Show the tags for the question being asked/answered.
DONE o 3/10/15 show the answer id in answer.__unicode__ in the admin [DONE 3/10/15]
DONE o 12/27/14 Show the number of questions for each tag (total number of questions, and number of questions past deadline)
DONE o postgres backups (via Makefile)
DONE o User login
DONE - add tags via Django Admin

Naming ideas / considerations:
----------------------------------------
    - use a two-part name (e.g., Evernote, Wunderlist, Tweetbot)
    - use a strange name (e.g., Google, Yahoo)
    - pronounceability
    - 11 chars or less
    - use a prefix or suffix (e.g., app, go, get) (e.g., outsideapp.com)
    - check domain names
    - account name availability on Facebook and Twitter
    - easy to remember
    - use real words with a twist (Ford Mustang)
    - create a compound word
    - make up a word
    - add on a prefix (e.g., Coursera)
    - add a pleasing word (e.g., Fountain)
