Wed 5/28/14 9:02pm
    9:12pm next: add the tag checkboxes
    9:12pm yes, tags are now working
    9:10pm see if migration worked and I can now look at tags
    9:10pm created and applied South migration for questions:
        ./manage.py schemamigration questions --auto

    9:07pm How to create a new South migration?
    9:06pm Yes, I have South migrations
    9:06pm see if I have South installed
    9:02pm the app is working; but the admin gives the error;
           I got the error in the admin when clicking on a tag to see details for the tag:
            ProgrammingError at /admin/questions/tag/2/
            relation "questions_tag_users" does not exist
            LINE 1: ...e_user"."id" FROM "emailusername_user" INNER JOIN "questions...
        I think I need to do a syncdb or migrate.

    5:52pm "manage.py runserver" giving error:
        django.core.management.base.CommandError: One or more models did not validate:
        questions.tag: 'users' has an m2m relation with model User, which has either not been installed or is abstract.
        SOLUTION: make a many2many field with User instead of 'User'
    5:51pm models are correct; see if I can add tags for a question in the admin
    5:45pm see if models are correct
    5:45pm get tags working on quizme program
    5:44pm next: continue on quizme program
    5:44pm learn_form_checkbox_for_manytomany_field working!
    5:34pm Next: update learn_form_checkbox_for_manytomany_field 
Tue 5/27/14 8:10am
    8:10am Got it working!  Now update learn_form_checkbox_for_manytomany_field with it.
Sun 5/25/14 8:10pm
    10:42pm I finished posting the question to stackoverflow.
    10:12pm post to stackoverflow!
    9:30pm try: >>> f.fields['name'].label = "Username"
    9:09pm Post to stackoverflow:
    Tags: django-forms django-modelformsets django-modelform django
    Title: How to set formset form widget.label with value of other model field
    Body:
        I have a modelformset for a `PersonTag` model with 3 fields, and I want to display a checkbox widget for the `PersonTag.enabled` field, and no widget for the other two fields.  For each checkbox, I want the label to be set to the `PersonTag.tag` value for that model instance.  How might I accomplish this?

    8:10pm see if I can use a HiddenInput
Fri 5/23/14 4:16pm
    4:16pm preparing to post to stackoverflow
Fri 5/23/14 7:07am
    7:51am tried the "for field in form", but it's now showing the widgets (post to stackoverflow for this)
    7:07am to add the tag name, consider:
        1) subclassing BaseFormSet.add_fields() to add an additional field
            https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/forms/formsets/
        -or-
        2) using HiddenInputs and using the value of those in the template to specify the name
        -or-
        3) just adding an additional key to the formset dict in the view, and using that in the template
        -or-
        4)  
            {% for field in form %}
                <th>{{ field.label }}</th>
                <td>{{ field.widget }}</td>
            {% endfor %}
        -or-
        5) Give a label to the tag field.  Maybe Django will show the label but not the HiddenInput widget
        -or-
        6) look at the Django source code for a widget

Thu 5/22/14 6:00pm
    6:00pm to add the tag name, consider:
        1) subclassing BaseFormSet.add_fields() to add an additional field
            https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/forms/formsets/
        -or-
        2) using HiddenInputs and using the value of those in the template to specify the name
        -or-
        3) just adding an additional key to the formset dict in the view, and using that in the template
Thu 5/22/14 6:55am
    7:21am now figure out how to add the tag name
    7:21am fixed the three projects that are using it
    7:21am it works!  
    6:56am test out my modelformset_factory(widgets=...) fix
Wed 5/21/14 7:19am
    5:45pm I discovered my problem!  I'm specifying the HiddenInput widgets in the forms.PersonTagForm, but that form is not being used by the factory.  I need to pass the widgets arg to the factory.
    7:55am I queried stackoverflow for "django modelformset_factory hiddeninput" and found some posts, one that mentions different behavior with the "extra" field; try extra=0 and extra=1
    7:19am post question to stackoverflow
    Tags: Django django-modelformsets django-modelform factory widget
    Title: Why doesn't Django modelformset_factory formset recognize HiddenInput widgets?
        For my ModelForm, I'm specifying two fields as HiddenInput fields.  This works as desired if I use a ModelForm instance in my view and template.  But when I use modelformset_factory, the fields are no longer hidden.  Why not?

Tue 5/20/14 7:45am
    7:47am learn_modelform_hidden_field -- HiddenInput widgets are working; it is correctly only showing the checkbox for the GET, and the dropdowns are hidden fields
Mon 5/19/14 5:30pm
    5:41pm learn_modelform_hidden_field: LEFT OFF modifying it to use a ModelForm instead of a ModelFormset
    5:30pm try using just a ModelForm without a formset
Mon 5/19/14 6:58am
    2:42pm create stackoverflow question
    7:23am fix "model = Tag" for TagForm in the other projects
    7:22am I discovered that I had set "model = Person" for the TagForm; not sure what that was doing
    6:58am try:
        o look at Django code
        o try hidden widgets
        o try removing fields
Sat 5/17/14 8:22pm
    8:59pm consider asking Aaron, Kyle, or Nick (put it in a git repo)
    8:59pm consider asking StackOverflow
    8:59pm I created learn_modelformset_make_field_hidden_or_remove_it and set widgets in the Meta for the form, but it didn't seem to do anything.
    8:22pm this shows two options:
            1) make field a HiddenInput field
            -or-
            2) delete it from fields
Sat 5/17/14 4:42pm
    5:00pm run with debugger and inspect the widgets
    4:46pm I want to change so that only the checkbox is shown
        consider: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11736322/django-how-to-override-fields-of-a-modelform-in-a-modelformset
    4:42pm learn_form_checkbox_for_manytomany_field - seems to be working; now figure out how to only show checkbox
Thu 5/15/14 7:43am
    7:44am how is it that tags for both users are showing up?
        A: It's because I'm using 
            queryset=PersonTag.objects.all())
        I have now fixed it by using filter(person=person)
    7:43am figure out how to only show checkbox and not the other two fields of the PersonTag ManyToMany field
Wed 5/14/14 5:03pm
    5:06pm get the POST working:
    5:05pm getting this error when submitting:
        NameError: global name 'ContactForm' is not defined
    5:04pm Now what?
Wed 5/7/14 9:18pm
    9:18pm Got page displaying!  Was using wrong filename for the template.
Wed 5/7/14 5:45pm
    5:45pm try printing out as_p() stuff; look up as_p() in other projects
    5:45pm learn_form_checkbox_for_manytomany_field - the page is now displaying, but there is no content; why not?
Tue 5/6/14 5:59pm
    6:16pm learn_form_checkbox_for_manytomany_field - the page is now displaying, but there is no content; why not?
    5:59pm learn_form_checkbox_for_manytomany_field - set_trace() to see why it's failing
Tue 5/6/14 7:43am
    8:30am got web page running; when I added a tag, and now I'm getting an exception:
        too many values to unpack
         person_tag = qs_person_tags.get(tag.tag_name) 
    7:43am learn_form_checkbox_for_manytomany_field - 
Mon 5/5/14 7:39am

Sun 5/4/14 8:35pm
    9:00pm learn_ModelFormset_modify_existing_instances_web_page -- it's working!!!
    8:55pm don't see any errors, so step through the code
    8:40pm got one form displaying, but it's not valid, and is not showing any errors
    8:35pm learn_forms_inline_formsets - see what is available for form options (form.as_p, ...); and see what the HTML source looks like
Sat 5/3/14 9:23pm
    9:54pm learn_forms_inline_formsets - got web page at least displaying; but it not displaying the data
    9:30pm how do I put a formset into a template?
    9:24pm learn_forms_inline_formsets - this has formset code, but I never got it working
    9:23pm learn_ModelFormset_modify_existing_instances_web_page - work on template for GET
Sat 5/3/14 11:47am
    12:13pm see if I have another django learn example using a formset in a template
    12:12pm I think I got view in place for GET, now fill in the template
    12:03pm find another project to copy view pattern for GET and POST
    12:00pm learn_ModelFormset_modify_existing_instances_web_page - complete this so that I know how to do it with a web page
    11:47am consider just adding any tags that don't already exist
Tue 4/29/14 7:56am
    7:57am next: 
Mon 4/28/14 5:50pm
    5:50pm can I start with a queryset, and add data onto it?
Sun 4/27/14 4:50pm
    4:52pm learn_ModelFormset_modify_existing_instances -- see if I can get by without add data;
    4:50pm continue working on learn_form_checkbox_for_manytomany_field: views.py - adding data to modelformset
Thu 4/24/14 6:00pm
    6:08pm continue working on learn_form_checkbox_for_manytomany_field: views.py - adding data to modelformset
    6:00pm see if it matters whether data is in a different order than the queryset
           FOUND: order of existing instances doesn't matter with the queryset 
Mon 4/21/14 8:01am
    8:01am  work on finishing learn_form_checkbox_for_manytomany_field
Thu 4/17/14 8:05am
    8:05am  figure out why I can't both modify an existing instance and add a new instance for learn_ModelFormset_modify_existing_instances
Wed 4/16/14 7:32am
    7:32am  next: work on the html template of the learn_form_checkbox_for_manytomany_field
Tue 4/15/14 7:39pm
    7:39pm  next: finish learn_form_checkbox_for_manytomany_field
Tue 4/15/14 7:38am
    7:47am  got learn_ModelFormset_modify_existing_instances working!!!
    7:38am  next: get learn_ModelFormset working with modifying existing instances
            learn_ModelFormset_modify_existing_instances
Sun 4/13/14 10:20pm
    10:24pm next: get learn_ModelFormset working with modifying existing instances
    10:23pm Got learn_ModelFormset working!
    10:21pm now working on getting learn_ModelFormset working
    10:20pm got learn_formset_stackoverflow_ask working (plain old formsets)
Sun 4/13/14 12:20pm
    12:20pm looking at learn_ModelForm
                - it's working
                - it creates a new instance, and modifies an existing instance
Fri 4/11/14 7:35am
    8:58am vdjango -- started summarizing forms and formsets; 
           explore further the relationship between ModelForm and not having an instance;
           nail down how a ModelForm works before using a ModelFormset;
           explore formsets and ModelFormsets separately
    7:35am consider posting a stackoverflow question; start with new learn project
Thu 4/10/14 5:45pm
    5:45pm Cannot figure out why formset has no save() method.  Consider looping through the formset and saving each instance:
        http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18700690/why-isnt-my-modelformset-saving
Wed 4/9/14 5:30pm
    6:00pm Note that, per Django docs, for initial values:
            These values are only displayed for unbound forms, and they’re not used as fallback values if a particular value isn’t provided.
    5:50pm formset.is_valid() is False because it is an unbound 
    5:30pm starting to work on cleaned_data AttributeError
Wed 4/9/14 8:45am
    8:45am figured out how to use inspect module to check for classes and methods
Tue 4/8/14 5:29pm
    5:36pm learn_formset: got most of attributes printing; cleaned_data is still raising an AttributeError
    5:29pm left off in learn_formset, printing out attr's of a form/formset.
           For some reason, dir(form) shows cleaned_data as an attribute, but it only
           gets shown if is_valid() is run.
Fri 4/4/14 8:35am
    8:39am consider stepping into the Django code and seeing what the error is
    8:35am learn_formset line 30: My formset is not valid, and there are no formset.errors or form.errors.  Why not?
    8:34am figuring out where I left off
Mon 3/31/14
    9:08am modelformset's are tied to a queryset; does a ModelForm object have to be tied to a model instance?
    8:20am learn_formset: started
    8:10am learn_forms_inline_formsets: not working; start a new easier one instead
Fri 3/28/14 
    5:30pm need to figure out how to process multiple forms from a template; use formsets; start with a project for learning how to use them
Thu 3/27/14
    8:24am learn_form_checkbox_for_manytomany_field: added instance; now need to add to template
Wed 3/26/14 5pm
    5:20pm next: finish learn_form_checkbox_for_manytomany_field and learn_checkboxes_for_every_boolean_record
    5:19pm learn_form_1: modified mycmd to specify all the fields
    5:02pm working on getting learn_form_1 mycmd working
    5:00pm Forget about figuring out how to use existing field value if not specified.
Wed 3/26/14 8am
    9:03am NEXT: figure out how to use existing field value if not specified (just like for Atlatl)
    9:00am got learn_ModelForm working with not requiring all fields.  However, updating an existing instance does not use the existing field value if not specified.
    8:58am got ModelForm working when creating a new instance in learn_ModelForm.  However, when updating an existing instance, the fields are still required.  Make them not required.
    8:44am figuring how how a ModelForm takes fields
    8:35am beginning learn_form_1 mycmd
Tue 3/25/14 4pm
    5:10pm LEFT OFF: get learn_form_1 mycmd working
    5:09pm modified learn_form_1 mycmd to understand how to use a ModelForm;
    5:00pm creating a project to learn how to map an instance
    4:53pm Now need to figure out how to map an instance to the form:
        MyForm(instance=my_instance)
    4:52pm Figured out how to instantiate a form.
    4:51pm Working on learn_form_1 to figure out how to instantiate a form();
    4:50pm Working on learn_form_checkbox_for_manytomany_field
Mon 3/17/14 8am
    understanding how a single checkbox should work in the follow scenarios:
        - ManyToMany field with two specified values
        - a new instance
        - an existing instance
    working on learn_form_checkbox_for_manytomany_field
Fri 3/14/14 10am
    detailing how the functionality should work
Wed 3/12/14 5pm
    left off: exploring different tagging methods after googling; explore django-taggit by Alex Gaynor some more, and also some blog posts
    Next: get checkboxes for the boolean values
    + Got working with showing the page.  
    resuming work on learn_checkboxes_for_every_boolean_record
    + modified code for view, forms, and html template
Tue 3/11/14 9am
    Working on the view for learn_checkboxes_for_every_boolean_record
Mon 3/10/14 5pm
    Decided I'm done with learn_aaron_inline_formsets.
    Resuming learn_checkboxes_for_every_boolean_record
    Created the models, now figuring out what to create for the view.
Fri 3/7/14 5pm
    Reading through Django documentation on formsets.
Thu 3/6/14 6pm
    Copied Aaron Sykes' inlineformset_factory project into learn.  
    Read about sqlite3 in wikipedia.
    LEFT OFF: documenting how Aaron's inlineformset_factory works.
Thu 3/6/14 8am
    Added a boolean field to learn_ModelForm and proved that it uses a checkbox.
    Went through learn_form_1 and determined what it was doing.
    Went through learn_form_1a_customize_form_html and determined it was using html instead of {{ form.as_p }}
    Next: keep going through other learn*form* projects to get a thorough understanding of forms.
Wed 3/5/14 5pm
    LEFT OFF: discovered stackoverflow post of using formsets for each one
    Looked at Postgresql bit strings.  Don't see it supported in Django.
    Continuing to work on checkboxes project.

Thu 2/13/14 7am
    Working on Django learn project for checkboxes for all the tags.
Tue 2/11/14 7am
    Next: implement tags via checkboxes or radio buttons.  First create a Django learn project.
    Consider:
        
        event.members = form.cleaned_data['members']
    Add saving of tags for a user:
        default to all tags

Mon 2/10/14 9am
    Next:
    It now works!!!!
    SOLUTION: added admin.py code 
    I looked at learn_django_doc_example_custom_user_mycmd_create_users and found that I forgot
    all the admin.py code.  I have now added it.
Sun 2/9/14 3pm
    Next: try the learn project to see how it's storing passwords
    Reason: it looks like creating a user through the admin is not encrypting the password.
    Why can I login as a superuser, but not as a non-superuser?
    deleted rbednark@gmail.com and then re-created:
        FAIL: rbednark@gmail.com / p
    manage.py createsuperuser
        SUCCESS: superuser@bednark.com / p
    attempts:
        FAIL: rob / rob 
        FAIL: rbednark@gmail.com / p
    I have now set AUTH_USER_MODEL in settings.py

    What is being authenticated?  auth_user or emailusername_user?
    Currently logged-in as: [rob]
    auth_user:
        rob
        rbednark
    emailusername_user:
        rbednark@gmail.com
    I think it's because I forgot settings AUTH_USER_MODEL in settings.py

Thu 2/6/14 9am
    I set a trace to see what the error is.  It is here:
        /Users/rob/.virtualenvs/quizme/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/contrib/auth/backends.py(16)authenticate()
    Added a logout link via a base.html page.
    login as rbednark@gmail.com / p: 
        Your username and password didn't match. Please try again.
        (I confirmed that rbednark@gmail.com / p in the admin are correct, and is_active=True)
    login as rob / rob:
        
Wed 2/5/14 7am
    Problem: getting this error:
        Cannot assign "<SimpleLazyObject: <User: rob>>": "Attempt.user" must be a "User" instance.
    Theory: I think it's because I'm logged-in as an auth_user instead of an emailusername_user
    Next: add a logout link
    Status: added a base.html page.  Including it in the other 2 pages.
Tue 2/4/14 6pm
    Next: resolve the csrf error
    Got the login screen working.  Now there is a csrf error:
        CSRF token missing or incorrect.
    Got the django learn project working to use the login screen.
Tue 2/4/14 8am
    Next: implement custom login page
    Got learn_custom_user_login_page_form_view working.
Mon 2/3/14 5pm
    Working on learn_custom_user_login_page_form_view
    Added a custom form.  Now add a custom view, subclassed from login() view

    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/default/

    Start implementing the login form.  We'll need it anyway.

    If I did implement saving an anonymous user as a user, it would have to be done
    when they first go into a quiz.  That could potentially mean a lot of anonymous users.
    Could choose to purge them after every n days.
    Furthermore, might need a way to convert an anonymous user to an existing user.
    Maybe that would be easy -- just fill in their fields (email addr, first name, last name)
Mon 2/3/14 8am
    Anonymous users do not have a User instance.  Figuring out how to save them as an actual user.  Created a django learn project.
    Implementing...
    Maybe it's not worth it.
Sun 2/2/14 8pm
    Fixed error.
    Now getting another error:
        Cannot assign "1": "Attempt.user" must be a "User" instance.
Sun 2/2/14 11am
    Changed from sqlite3 to postgres.  Create initial migrations again.  Now get an error:
        column questions_attempt.datetime_updated does not exist
        LINE 1: ...empt"."id", "questions_attempt"."datetime_added", "questions...
    Next: need to allow superuser to add tags/questions in Django Admin.
    Added Tag ManyToMany with Question.
    Added ManyToMany both ways in Django Admin.
Sat 2/01/14 10am
    Next: add tags
    Users now work.
    Added foreign keys to User.
    Added a user_ app to quizme.
    Now add user to my model.
    Satisfied that subclassing AbstractBaseUser also has all the authentication/permission functionality.
    On plan from Charleston.
    learn_django_doc_example_custom_user -- this is done and just creates a custom user by subclassing AbstractBaseUser.
    I figured out that create_user() is a method of the manager, not of the user.

Sun 1/26/14 2pm
    On plane to Charleston.  Working on creating users and logging-in.
Fri 1/24/14 6pm
    Did some googling.  It doesn't look like it's easy to modify the Django authentication to use email addresses instead of usernames.
    Decided to use Tom Christie's django-email-as-username library.
    Working on learn_django_email_as_username
Thu 1/23/14 5pm
    Finished new template_django_1_6_1
    Now working on learn_django_user_authentication
    Left off: reading about Django user authentication
        https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/topics/auth/
        https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/topics/auth/customizing/
Thu 1/23/14 9am
    Working on creating and authenticating users.  Creating a learn project for it.  Right now, I'm creating a new template_django_1_6_1 based off of Django 1.6.1
    Left to do: 
        settings.py
Wed 1/22/14 9pm
    Got it working.  Works with 3 questions.  Cycles through.
    Next step?  Maybe tests.
Wed 1/22/14 5pm
    I think I got it working.  Add another question to see if it really works.
Wed 1/22/14 8am
    I added a "question" field to the form, but this doesn't make any sense.  Question is not an input.  I think I just added it to make it easy to display the question.  Take it out and pass it explicitly.

    Do I really want a different template for showing the first question vs showing an answer
    and the next question?  For now it's fine.  Keep moving on.
Tue 1/21/14 8am
    Left off changing field names in forms and views.
    States:
        - initial GET:
            - show the question
        - POST
            - new template:
                - show the answer, the user's attempt, the question
                - have a NEXT button be a GET for the next question
Mon 1/20/14 6pm
    I got the hidden input to work.  Now need to figure out what to do next.
Mon 1/20/14 8am
    Trying different things to get the HiddenInput to work.  I think it is due to these lines in the view:
            form_attempt.fields['question_id'] = question.id
            form_attempt.fields['question_id'] = None
    I think it should be something like ['initial'], otherwise I think it's overriding the widget.
Fri 1/17/14 6pm
    Tried putting explicit <input> in the form, and then it put the <input> widget in the "value".
    Baffling.
Fri 1/17/14 8am
    Googled.  Tried .as_hidden and using ()'s when setting the widget.  Still not working.  Might not to explicitly put it in the form.
    Look at the Django code to see what the HiddenInput widget does.
Thu 1/16/14 8am
    Added errors to form so can see what the error is.
    It is saying that question_id is not present in the form.
    I set a breakpoint and confirmed that question_id is not in request.POST.
    Now check to see if question_id is getting in the form.  I see it as one of the fields, but because I'm not using form.as_p(), it's not getting put into the form.
Wed 1/15/14 8am
    Figured out that my for is not valid.  Now trying to figure out how to show Django form errors manually, and then eventually using Django generic class-based views.
Tue 1/14/14 5pm
    Got view to show question working, and next_question() code working.
    Now getting an exception after clicking "submit".
Tue 1/14/14 9am
    Added code for next_question().  
    Added code to pass question_id as hidden field.  Now test it.
Mon 1/13/14 8am
    Looking at django-quiz to see how he did it.
    Still have to decide how to pass fields.  I want to go with hidden fields.
    Got django-quiz up and running.  Needed to do a "django-admin.py startproject", and add the apps.  I didn't actually get the templates working.
    Options:
        pass hidden fields
        pass query parameters (http://quizme.com?parm=value
Fri 1/9/14 8pm
    Got the hidden field working!  Now add it to quizme.
    Want to redirect to the next question by passing the hidden value of the current question.
    Could also pass it in the URL as the ID of the question.
Fri 1/9/14 8am
    working on getting hidden field working; found form.fields['myfield']['initial'] but it is not right
Thu 1/9/14 6pm
    Working on learn_form_hidden_field.  Got the hidden field, now need to see if it's passing a value.
    It's passing the initial value and saving that.  Now I have to see if I can set it to something else.
    How do I set the value for a field?
    Set a trace and see what the values are.
Thu 1/9/14 9am
    o Learned how to use a hidden field.  Now need to figure out how to set the value for the hidden field in the view instead of just using the initial value.
      Created learn_form_hidden_field.
Wed 1/8/14 6pm
    o Got admin working.
    o Next: redirect to the next question; started working on; need hidden field
Wed 1/8/14 10am
    o Got it saving an attempt.  Now need to work on a redirect to the next question.  Also need to add Attempt to the admin.  Left off making changes to the admin.
Tue 1/7/14 6pm
    o Got the form displaying correctly for the GET.
      ERROR when submitting: 'FormAttempt' object has no attribute 'cleaned_data'

Tue 1/7/14 9am
    o Working on the view and template.  Decided to use form for the answer, and just put the question in directly.  Still modifying the view code and the template.
Mon 1/6/14 6pm:
  o I'm trying to figure out how to do a read-only field; what I want:
        o display the question
        o have a box for the answer:
        o when submitting, only allow the answer
    Maybe what I should do is create a form just for the answer, and in the template put the questionas well.
  
Mon 1/6/14 8am:
  o work on implementing the view; was going to use a form, not sure if I use Django Forms (because I have readonly field of question) or not.

Fri 1/3/14:
  
  o got it working; added a question and answer via the admin
  o added 'questions' to INSTALLED_APPS
  o enabled the admin
  o added requirements.txt file
  o installed South
  o got Django 1.6.1 installed
Mon 10/14/13:
  o LEFT OFF: working on learn_GenericForeignKey.polymorphic.contentType; can't figure out how to chain querysets together
  o worked on the models; now figuring out how to use GenericForeignKey for the tag
  o played with django_versioning again to see how it works; decided to continue working on the models
Thu 10/3/13
  o NEXT STEP: create a basic question and answer models, and add the Django REST Framework API
  o completed the Django REST Framework Quickstart, and skimmed the tutorial
  o working on learn_django_rest_framework project
Tue 10/1/13
  o create learn_django_rest_framework project
Mon 9/30/13
  o If I use a REST API and AJAX, what should my first feature be?
    Being able to add questions.  Tag questions.  Modify questions.
  o installed django REST Framework: pip install djangorestframework
  o What should I do next?  I would like to create a REST API and use a JavaScript front-end.  Maybe I will use django-rest-framework.

Thu 9/19/13
  o got it running; can see revisions in Django Admin; 
  o need to run syncdb before versioning_setup
  o installed django-debug-toolbar
Wed 9/18/13
  o ran "manage.py version_setup..." command and got:
    ImportError: No module named debug_toolbar
  o finished modifying code
Tue 9/17/13
  o started playing with django-versioning in learn_django-versioning_package
        LEFT OFF: adding code to models.py
  o researching model instance versioning approaches (capturing every time an instance is modified)
Mon 9/16/13
  o added models
================================================================================
!TODO / Backlog
================================================================================
o Tags (be able to tag questions, and then select tags from which to select questions)
    - select a single tag to use for a quiz
    - select multiple tags to use for a quiz
    - consider allowing a hierarchy of tags, e.g.,
        Programming
            Languages
                Python
                Perl
                C
            Methodologies
                Agile
      Maybe allowing multiple parent/child relationships.
o Frequency (user selects when they want to see again (hr, day, 2 days, week, month, 2 mos)
o NewUser registration
    - page to create account
    - email address verification/registration
o tests
o Footer: 
    - show tags
    - show how many times seen
    - show how many times answered
    - show last time seen
    - show total number of questions
o Review mode: just show questions and answers
o email questions
o deploy to heroku

o Rich Text for questions and answers
o graph database
o Questions (add questions from the web page)
o Questions (modify questions from the web page while asking the question)
o unique url's (e.g., either based on question words, or based on an id)
o "Ignore" tag -- never see the question again
o private questions/answers
o add Google Analytics

Front-end:
o tag questions
o add questions/answers
o modify questions/answers on-the-fly
o versions of questions/answers

DONE o User login
DONE - add tags via Django Admin

o Ask a question, and then show the answer.
    quiz view:
        form:
            if GET:
                ask the first question
            elif POST:
                tell server which question was just asked
  Format:
    1) Show user a question
    2) give user an input box to put their answer
    3) Submit (user submits their answer)
    4) save the user's answer, and show the correct answer, along with a Next button
    5) Next (user clicks Next to go to the next question)
    6) go to (1)
